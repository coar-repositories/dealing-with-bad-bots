## The Dealing with Bad Bots COAR Task Group

## Goals

1. Understand and document the problem space sufficiently (and collect evidence where possible)
2. Understand and document the available mitigation strategies
3. Reiterate the importance of allowing legitimate machine-access to repositories
4. Make recommendations to repository managers about effective mitigation strategies which do not create problems for legitimate remote system access.
5. Make recommendations to COAR about the what, if anything, can and should be done beyond this.

## Schedule

The task group was formed in July 2025 and is expected to deliver its short-term outputs in the second half of 2025. The group may continue beyond this period, depending on the outcome of Goal 5 (above). Some ideas which have already been suggested include providing a forum for discussion and evaluation of possible interventions at the network-level - e.g. community maintained infrastructure to aid repositories in mitigating the effects of bad bots.
