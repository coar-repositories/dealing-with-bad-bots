## Update

I have made some progress, based on some of the discussion during and since the first meeting.

### Name change

The task group is now called the Dealing with Bad Bots COAR Task Group

### Parallel processes

Particularly in the discussion following the first meeting, it became apparent that we might usefully arrange this in parallel activities.

#### 1. Immediate term
We are initially concerned with producing a document to advise repository managers in the immediate term. This is fairly urgent, because there is a risk that repository managers will adopt - or be obliged by their institutions to adopt - defensive measures which are counter productive to our shared vision of well supported machine access to repositories.

- I have begun to [draft a document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s5-Q2yaJXP5Efu5ODyAQ-mR-EOGJyx9gU0cWH1fAQjk/edit) based on our discussion at the last meeting
- As agreed at the meeting, I have also extracted the various "mitigations" and attempted to characterise these more clearly (in particular applying Petr's suggestion of the "affects good bots" and "affects bad bots" division) in a [Google sheet:](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zF7vQoEFEpA3n_aJxKrp5yJxBHHsJYpDNd_2K0x72TY/edit)
- We also now have a [public Zotero group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/6065273/dealing_with_bad_bots_coar_task_group) (thanks Patrick!) for sharing references. You should be able to join this and add references if you want to.

#### 2. Longer term

- In the longer term we may need to consider adopting or even developing more complex solutions, ranging from shared "allow lists" to more sophisticated infrastructure. There have already been some ideas floated by email. We need a place to discuss and develop these ideas.
- I have established a [Github repository,](https://github.com/coar-repositories/dealing-with-bad-bots) (this repository) with the idea that we can use this to manage and publish outputs, and use GitHub issues for suggesting and discussing ideas:
- Let me know if you would like write access to this. If you have a strong idea, then please create a Github issue to raise and discuss this.
